walk through how it works:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Player Position Probabilities:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Using a multinomial model based on all combine measurables,
probability values are returned for all positions (excluding
specialists).</li>
<li>Any combination of metrics can be input (e.g., Height, Weight,
Forty, Shuttle), and a prediction will be made.</li>
<li>It should be noted, however, that missing metrics will be estimated
based on the given metrics. Therefore, if this is the primary test of
interest, including as many known measurables as possible is
preferred.</li>
<li>In any case, including height and weight is necessary for proper
position predictions.</li>
<li>Bench press is not considered in the model. This is because it is
not completed by many Quarterbacks. So, in order to have that as a
predictable position, it was removed.</li>
<li>Specialists are not included in predictions.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Spider Plot:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Based on the measurables inputted, a spider plot will be generated
that shows the percentiles in which a player would be placed compared to
past combine results.</li>
<li>The plot offers the ability to compare to any position group.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Player comparisons:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Comparison players are generated using a k-nearest neighbors
algorithm.</li>
<li>Filters can be set to compare players based on a specific year
range.</li>
<li>In contrast to the previous outputs, player comparisons have more
flexibility when handling non-inputted values.</li>
<li>Many players who complete the NFL Combine may not participate in all
events. Considering this, inputting only metrics such as height, weight,
forty, and vertical may return more potential comparisons than inputting
all measurables.</li>
<li>You can experiment with any combination of variables to see how they
compare to past combine performances. For instance, you may be
interested in how your jumping measurables or agility measurables alone
compare to past players.</li>
</ul>
